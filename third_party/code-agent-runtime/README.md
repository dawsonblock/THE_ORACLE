# Code Agent Runtime

A bounded Python-first code agent with three layers:

- a local execution pipeline that edits only an isolated worktree
- optional GitHub App publishing for checks, comments, draft PRs, and branch-protection inspection
- optional Docker sandbox execution with language-aware image selection

It is still intentionally narrow.

## What it does

1. ingest a GitHub issue payload or local issue task
2. create or use an isolated git worktree
3. localize likely files
4. search across a bounded number of candidate files for a valid patch
5. run patch preflight, syntax validation, and broader targeted pytest selection
6. emit a draft-PR artifact locally or open a real draft PR through a GitHub App
7. run batch evaluations from a SWE-bench-style JSONL manifest

## Safety boundary

- no autonomous merge
- no direct default-branch push
- no writing outside the managed worktree
- no reflection-driven live repo writes
- no network access inside the Docker sandbox by default
- no production secrets inside the workspace

## What is implemented

- canonical schemas and append-only SQLite event store
- safe repo cache and git worktree manager
- GitHub webhook normalization and issue parsing
- minimal planner with explicit file localization heuristics
- bounded patch builder using explicit `File`, `Replace`, and `With` instructions
- multi-attempt candidate search across ranked files
- patch guard and diff summarizer
- validation ladder: preflight, syntax, broader targeted pytest selection
- local reporter that writes draft-PR or comment artifacts
- GitHub App auth, checks, issue comments, draft PR wiring, and branch protection inspection
- Docker command runner with `--network none`
- language-aware sandbox image policy for Python, JS/TS, and Rust repos
- SWE-bench-style local harness and manifest runner
- unit and integration tests

## What is still missing

- full semantic program repair across large repos
- hermetic build reproduction for arbitrary dependency graphs
- live GitHub App verification from this environment
- true production hardening for secrets, quotas, and fleet-scale scheduling
## Added in this build

- richer issue parsing: stack-trace file extraction, ignore lists, search terms, symbols, and per-issue attempt/file caps
- improved localization and ranking using issue tokens, content hints, symbol matches, and ignore rules
- richer bounded patch strategies: insert-before, insert-after, append-text, and function-scoped Python return rewrites
- stricter patch guardrails for oversized diffs, assertion-only removals, and lockfile-like path changes
- more unit coverage for parser, localizer, planner, patch builder, and patch guard upgrades



## New in 0.7.0

- repo profiles from `pyproject.toml` or `.agent/runtime.yaml`
- command overrides per language
- custom test roots and ignore paths
- flaky-aware retry for targeted and full test runs
- richer attempt summaries with validation commands and dependency snapshots
